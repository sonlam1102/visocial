# Source code file name convention:
The source code are written in Python with Jupyter notebook 
The name of the files are written as follow: "<dataset> <type of models> <a>_<b>.jpynb"   
<dataset>: the name of dataset (ViHSD or ViCTSD) 
<type of models>: the type of model. DNN - Deep neural network. Monolingual transformer and Multilingual transformer.
<a>: aug - the model trained on the augmented data. If there are no "aug" term, the model trained on the original dataset. 
<b>: no_pp - no pre-processing techniques. If there are no "no-pp" term, the model trained with pre-processing steps as described in the paper.
