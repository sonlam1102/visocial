# Source code file name convention:
The source code are written in Python with Jupyter notebook

The name of the files are written as follow: "&lt;dataset&gt; &lt;type of models&gt; &lt;a&gt;_&lt;b&gt;.jpynb"   

+ &lt;dataset&gt;: the name of dataset (ViHSD or ViCTSD) 

+ &lt;type of models&gt;: the type of model. DNN - Deep neural network. Monolingual transformer and Multilingual transformer.

+ &lt;a&gt;: aug - the model trained on the augmented data. If there are no "aug" term, the model trained on the original dataset. 

+ &lt;b&gt;: no_pp - no pre-processing techniques. If there are no "no-pp" term, the model trained with pre-processing steps as described in the paper.
